## 1. Fourier Transform
The transform is defined by the following integral:

$$
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} dx
$$

> Formula: This represents the frequency domain version of a signal.

You can also use inline math like $\pi = 3.14$ for quick variables.

## 1. Fourier Transform
The Fourier Transform of a signal $f(x)$ is given by:

$$
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} dx
$$

> Formula: Use this to convert time-domain signals to the frequency domain.
