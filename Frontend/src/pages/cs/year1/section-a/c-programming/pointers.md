## What is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable.

> **Key Concept:** Pointers allow direct memory access, which is crucial for dynamic allocation and performance.

### Example Code

```c
int main() {
    int var = 20;
    int *ptr = &var;
    printf("Value: %d", *ptr);
}
## 1. Fourier Transform
The formula is:
$$ \hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} dx $$
> Formula: Use this for signal processing notes.
